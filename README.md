# IEEE Micromouse Project

## Goal
* Design autonomous car that can navigate itself to the middle of the maze

## Software (in C language)
* Implemented PID to control the two motors of the car 
* Implemented the floodfill algorithm to help the car keep track of the path it has travelled and update its distance matrix accordingly

## Hardware
### Mouse PCB
* Incorporated H-bridge, photodiodes, IR sensors, transistors, and capacitors on to the mouse PCB
* Uploaded the code with different hardware configuration to test out PID constants

### IR Breakout Board
* Designed a PCB with three photodiodes and IR sensors in Eagle
* Thickened the tracing to ensure optimal current

## Results
* Download and watch the video [here](https://github.com/erictang0220/IEEE-Micromouse/blob/main/micromouse/good%20no%20aud%202.mov)
* [PCB in design](https://github.com/erictang0220/IEEE-Micromouse/blob/main/micromouse/Eagle%20breakout%20board.png) and the [final product](https://github.com/erictang0220/IEEE-Micromouse/blob/main/micromouse/made%20breakout%20board.png)!
