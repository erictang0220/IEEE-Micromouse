# IEEE Micromouse Project

## Goal
* Design autonomous car that can navigate itself to the middle of the maze

## Software (in C language)
* Implemented PID to control the two motors of the car 
* Implemented the floodfill algorithm to help the car keep track of the path it has travelled and update its distance matrix accordingly

## Hardware
### Mouse PCB
* Incorporated H-bridge, photodiodes, IR sensors, transistors, and capacitors on to the mouse PCB
* Uploaded the code with different hardware configuration to test out PID constants

### IR Breakout Board
* Designed a PCB with three photodiodes and IR sensors in Eagle
* Thickened the tracing to ensure optimal current

## Results
* Watch the video here!
* PCB in design and the final product!
